# MyFuncCollection

Collection of common functions, classes, methods I use for my PhD.
Written in Python and Julia.  
Python and Julia files have some common functions, but also a lot of different ones:  
  
+ Python file contains mostly for data processing and statistical inference
+ Julia contains mostly files to generate traffic, calculate influence line and load effect, and some statistical functions to support it.
