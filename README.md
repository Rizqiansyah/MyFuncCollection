# MyFuncCollection

Collection of common functions, classes, methods I use for my PhD.
Written in Python and Julia.  
Python and Julia files have some common functions, but also a lot of different ones:  
  
+ Python file contains mostly for data processing and statistical inference
+ Julia contains mostly files to generate traffic, calculate influence line and load effect, and some statistical functions to support it.

Please credit me if you use any of these functions. I'd also be very happy if you let me know!
